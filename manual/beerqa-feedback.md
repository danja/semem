## Overview

The BeerQA Iterative Feedback Workflow represents the next evolution in automated question-answering systems, building upon the Enhanced Workflow v2 and Wikidata integration. This version introduces **automated feedback loops** that detect incomplete answers, generate targeted follow-up questions, research those questions iteratively, and synthesize comprehensive final answers.

The system transforms incomplete responses containing phrases like "additional information would be helpful" into comprehensive, well-researched answers through intelligent iteration and automated knowledge discovery.

## Architecture

The iterative feedback workflow operates on four primary RDF graphs with advanced metadata tracking:
- **BeerQA Graph** (`http://purl.org/stuff/beerqa/test`): Questions, formal relationships, iterative metadata, and generated follow-ups
- **Wikipedia Graph** (`http://purl.org/stuff/wikipedia/research`): Wikipedia corpuscles and content  
- **Wikidata Graph** (`http://purl.org/stuff/wikidata/research`): Global Wikidata entities and properties
- **Navigation Graph** (`http://purl.org/stuff/navigation/enhanced`): Enhanced ZPT navigation results

**Scripts should be run from the root dir of the project, some include paths.**

## Core Innovation: Feedback Loop System

### Feedback Detection Engine
- **Pattern Analysis**: Detects 17+ incompleteness patterns ("additional information would be helpful", "cannot determine", etc.)
- **LLM Completeness Scoring**: Advanced scoring (0-100%) with detailed reasoning
- **Automatic Question Generation**: Extracts 2-3 targeted follow-up questions per incomplete response

### Iterative Research Pipeline
```
Original Question ‚Üí Enhanced Answer ‚Üí Completeness Analysis
    ‚Üì (if incomplete)
Generate Follow-up Questions ‚Üí Store with Metadata ‚Üí Research Follow-ups
    ‚Üì
Enhanced Context ‚Üí Next Iteration ‚Üí Final Synthesis
```
