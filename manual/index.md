# Semem Technical Manual

**Semantic Web Memory for Intelligent Agents**

## Introduction

Semem is a sophisticated Node.js toolkit that bridges artificial intelligence and semantic web technologies, providing intelligent memory management and knowledge graph processing capabilities for AI applications. This manual serves as the definitive technical reference for users, developers, and researchers working with Semem's advanced semantic memory systems.

### Core Architecture

Semem integrates three foundational systems:

- **üß† Semantic Memory System**: Advanced vector embeddings with intelligent context retrieval, featuring conversational AI interfaces and adaptive search algorithms
- **üï∏Ô∏è Knowledge Graph Processing**: Comprehensive RDF/SPARQL-based knowledge representation and augmentation using the [Ragno Ontology](https://github.com/danja/ragno)
- **üß≠ Multi-Dimensional Navigation**: ZPT (Zoom-Pan-Tilt) knowledge exploration system based on the [ZPT Ontology](https://github.com/danja/zpt)

### Primary Interfaces

#### Web Workbench
The **Semem Workbench** provides a comprehensive web-based interface featuring:
- **Interactive Chat**: Natural language conversation with automatic context enhancement
- **Semantic Verbs**: Structured operations (Tell, Ask, Augment, Navigate, Inspect, Console)
- **Document Processing**: Support for PDF, text, and markdown file ingestion
- **External Enhancement**: Automatic integration with Wikipedia, Wikidata, and HyDE systems

#### Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server

**NB. some of the docs are out of date. For sanity's sake the MCP has been streamlined down to 7 core tools, most of the others are deprecated.**

The **MCP Protocol Server** enables seamless AI integration through:

#### Additional Interfaces
- **HTTP REST API**: 43 endpoints for programmatic access to all system capabilities
- **Direct SDK**: Node.js library for embedded applications
- **Command-Line Tools**: Utilities for batch processing and system administration

### Key Capabilities

- **Persistent Memory**: Conversations and knowledge persist across sessions with intelligent decay and prioritization
- **Adaptive Search**: Context-aware retrieval with quality scoring and multi-source enhancement
- **Knowledge Augmentation**: Automatic concept extraction, entity linking, and relationship discovery
- **Scalable Storage**: Support for in-memory, JSON file, and SPARQL triple store backends
