A script examples/document/FindMemory.js will use the same tooling as examples/document/AskHyde.js with the purpose of retrieving the location of a stored document in memory. It will take a text string from the command line which may contain a question, keywords or some other kind of reference to the document being searched for - this should be catered for in the prompt template. The end result to be presented to the user is a list of three references to text elements in order of relevance, together with the reference for each to their source document.
