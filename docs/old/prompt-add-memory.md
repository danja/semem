A tool is required to ingest new data that combines multiple processes. The new module src/ragno/Memorise.js will take a string and then call classes like those used in examples/document/LoadPDFs.js to create a ragno:Unit and associated ragno:TextElement with the content of the file. It should be constructed mostly of helper methods that call existing modules. The SPARQL UPDATE should use the system described in docs/manual/sparql-service.md to achieve this. The system should then do the calls found in examples/document/ChunkDocuments.js examples/document/MakeEmbeddings.js examples/document/ExtractConcepts.js examples/document/EnhanceCorpuscles.js examples/document/Decompose.js follow the patterns of core system calls in those scripts and the config setup of docs/manual/infrastructure.md 
An example script which takes as an argument a path to a text file will also be created examples/document/AddMemory.js which calls src/ragno/Memorise.js with the file contents, runs through the procedures and gives a summary of the operations.
Vitest unit and integration tests should be created to confirm the functionality of src/ragno/Memorise.js
