# ASK-RAGNO Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the AskRagno question-answering system, which allows users to enter questions and receive contextually augmented answers using the Semem knowledge management system.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Core Features Implemented
- **Question Processing**: Questions are stored as corpuscles using TextToCorpuscle patterns
- **Semantic Search**: Integration with DocumentSearchSystem for finding relevant context
- **Context Building**: Uses ContextManager to build comprehensive context from search results
- **LLM Integration**: Multi-provider LLM support with priority-based fallback chain
- **Interactive Mode**: CLI interface supporting both single questions and continuous Q&A sessions
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full unit and integration test coverage

## Architecture

### System Components
1. **AskRagnoSystem Class** - Main orchestrator following Semem infrastructure patterns
2. **Question Storage** - TextToCorpuscle integration for persistent question storage
3. **Search Integration** - DocumentSearchSystem for semantic search and context retrieval
4. **Context Management** - ContextManager for building augmented prompts
5. **LLM Response** - Multi-provider LLM integration with fallback support
6. **CLI Interface** - Command-line interface with interactive mode

### Data Flow
```
User Question → Store as Corpuscle → Search for Context → Build Augmented Prompt → Generate Answer
```

## Key Features

### 1. Question Processing
- Questions stored as corpuscles in SPARQL store for future reference
- Uses TextToCorpuscle patterns from ConsumeQuestion.js
- Supports custom graph names for multi-tenant scenarios

### 2. Semantic Search
- Integrates with DocumentSearchSystem for finding relevant information
- Uses dual search mode (exact + similarity) for comprehensive results
- Configurable search parameters (limit, threshold, modes)

### 3. Context Augmentation
- ContextManager builds comprehensive context from search results
- Intelligent context building with relevance scoring
- Support for multiple context sources and formats

### 4. LLM Integration
- Priority-based provider selection: Mistral → Claude → Ollama
- Configurable through config.json and environment variables
- Graceful fallback handling for provider failures

### 5. Interactive Experience
- Single question mode for one-off queries
- Interactive mode for continuous Q&A sessions
- Comprehensive statistics and performance monitoring

## File Structure
```
examples/document/AskRagno.js                      # Main implementation
tests/unit/examples/document/AskRagno.test.js      # Unit tests
tests/integration/examples/document/AskRagno.integration.test.js # Integration tests
docs/ASK-RAGNO-PLAN.md                             # This documentation
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Ask a single question
node examples/document/AskRagno.js "What is machine learning?"

# Interactive mode
node examples/document/AskRagno.js --interactive

# Custom graph
node examples/document/AskRagno.js "How do neural networks work?" --graph "http://example.org/my-docs"

# Verbose logging
node examples/document/AskRagno.js --interactive --verbose
```

### Configuration
The system uses standard Semem configuration patterns:

```json
{
  "storage": {
    "type": "sparql",
    "options": {
      "query": "http://localhost:3030/semem/query",
      "graphName": "http://tensegrity.it/semem",
      "user": "${SPARQL_USER}",
      "password": "${SPARQL_PASSWORD}"
    }
  },
  "llmProviders": [
    {
      "type": "mistral",
      "apiKey": "${MISTRAL_API_KEY}",
      "chatModel": "mistral-small-latest",
      "priority": 1,
      "capabilities": ["chat"]
    },
    {
      "type": "claude", 
      "apiKey": "${CLAUDE_API_KEY}",
      "chatModel": "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
      "priority": 2,
      "capabilities": ["chat"]
    },
    {
      "type": "ollama",
      "baseUrl": "http://localhost:11434",
      "chatModel": "qwen2:1.5b",
      "priority": 3,
      "capabilities": ["chat"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Prerequisites
1. **Document Processing Pipeline**: Complete document processing (LoadPDFs, ChunkDocuments, MakeEmbeddings, ExtractConcepts)
2. **SPARQL Endpoint**: Running and accessible with document data
3. **LLM Providers**: At least one LLM provider configured (Ollama recommended for fallback)
4. **Environment Variables**: API keys set in .env file

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- **Component Testing**: All major components tested in isolation
- **Mock Integration**: Comprehensive mocking of external dependencies
- **Error Handling**: Edge cases and error scenarios covered
- **Statistics**: Performance and usage statistics validation

### Integration Tests
- **End-to-End**: Complete workflow from question to answer
- **Error Resilience**: Handling of service failures and partial results
- **Performance**: Concurrent question processing and resource management
- **Configuration**: Real configuration loading and validation

## Performance Characteristics
- **Response Time**: Typical response times under 5 seconds
- **Concurrent Processing**: Supports multiple simultaneous questions
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and connection management
- **Statistics Tracking**: Built-in performance monitoring

## Error Handling
The system implements comprehensive error handling:
- **Service Failures**: Graceful handling of SPARQL, search, and LLM failures
- **Partial Results**: Continues processing with incomplete data
- **Configuration Errors**: Clear error messages for setup issues
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper cleanup even during error conditions

## Future Enhancements
- **Caching**: Response caching for frequently asked questions
- **Streaming**: Streaming responses for long-form answers
- **Multi-modal**: Support for image and document attachments
- **Feedback Loop**: Learning from user feedback and corrections
- **API Interface**: REST API for programmatic access

## Integration with Semem Ecosystem
- **Infrastructure Patterns**: Follows docs/manual/infrastructure.md guidelines
- **Configuration System**: Uses Config.js with environment variable support
- **SPARQL Integration**: SPARQLQueryService and template-based queries
- **Prompt Management**: Ready for unified prompt system integration
- **Provider System**: Standard LLM provider patterns with priority fallback

## Conclusion
The AskRagno system provides a complete question-answering solution that seamlessly integrates with the Semem knowledge management ecosystem. It demonstrates best practices for:
- Infrastructure pattern adherence
- Comprehensive testing coverage
- Error resilience and resource management
- User experience and CLI design
- Performance monitoring and statistics

The implementation is production-ready and provides a solid foundation for advanced question-answering capabilities in the Semem system.
