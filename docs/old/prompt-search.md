Create `examples/document/Search.js` which will use `src/ragno/search/index.js` to find nodes in the graph related to a question, ranked and filtered according to relevance. The question may be posed as a string or as a URI which identifies an existing node in the graph. This will call for some refactoring around `src/ragno/search/`. If new SPARQL services are required, create them according to `docs/manual/sparql-service.md`
Similarity search is already done in `examples/document/RAG.js` but you should look at ways of unifying the system, with the core code as modules under `src/ragno/search/`
