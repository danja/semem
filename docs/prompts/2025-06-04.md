Can you modify examples/RagnoSPARQLDemo.js to use the store via src/stores/SPARQLStore.js 

can you examine the code and explain how Semem uses short term and long term memory. Render your findings as two artifacts : a markdown doc and a mermaid diagram showing the flow

Can you create an artifact to add to the demos. It should operate like demos/01-memory-basic.js but using the SPARQL storage. Make its reporting verbose.
