the next step with Semem is to build tooling based on the concepts in the ZPT ontology. The Ragno ontology and code implementation is all about knowledgebase management, augmentation and retrieval, and ZPT will complement this by adding knowledgebase navigation facilities. Think deeply about how this may be achieved, following best practices and patterns in the existing codebase. Render your findings as an artifact zpt-plan.md . Also create a mermaid diagram of the planned architecure.
