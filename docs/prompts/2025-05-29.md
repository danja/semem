I have installed webpack. Can you modify the current browser ui setup to use it. Create the webpack config bearing in mind we are using es modules throughout.

  1. API server is running on port 4100 and receiving requests successfully for /api/config
  2. Frontend is requesting /api/providers but this endpoint doesn't exist (404 errors)
  3. Webpack dev server failed to start due to port 9000 being in use

  Let me fix this by creating the missing /api/providers endpoint and restarting the servers properly.

  check servers/api-server.js around line 264?
