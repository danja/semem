# Refactoring Plan for SPARQLStore.js

The `SPARQLStore.js` file is a large and complex module with multiple responsibilities. This makes it difficult to understand, maintain, and test. The goal of this refactoring is to split the file into smaller, more focused modules, each with a single responsibility.

## Proposed Modules:

1.  **`SPARQLCore.js`:** This module will be responsible for the low-level interaction with the SPARQL endpoint. It will contain the `executeSparqlQuery` and `executeSparqlUpdate` methods, as well as the transaction management logic (`beginTransaction`, `commitTransaction`, `rollbackTransaction`).

2.  **`SPARQLSearch.js`:** This module will be responsible for all the search-related functionality. It will contain the `findSimilarElements` method for vector similarity search, and the `search` method for basic string matching.

3.  **`SPARQLVector.js`:** This module will be responsible for all the vector-related functionality. It will contain the `calculateCosineSimilarity` and `adjustEmbeddingLength` methods. It will also manage the in-memory FAISS index.

4.  **`SPARQLCache.js`:** This module will be responsible for caching SPARQL query results. It will contain the logic for storing and retrieving cached results, as well as the cache invalidation logic.

5.  **`SPARQLData.js`:** This module will be responsible for loading and saving data from/to the SPARQL store. It will contain the `loadHistory` and `saveMemoryToHistory` methods, as well as the `storeEntity`, `storeSemanticUnit`, `storeRelationship`, and `storeCommunity` methods.

6.  **`SPARQLZPT.js`:** This module will be responsible for the ZPT-related functionality. It will contain the `queryByZoomLevel` and `buildFilterClauses` methods.

7.  **`SPARQLGraph.js`:** This module will be responsible for the graph-related functionality. It will contain the `traverseGraph` and `validateCorpus` methods.

## Refactoring Steps:

1.  Create the new files for each module.
2.  Move the relevant code from `SPARQLStore.js` to the new modules.
3.  Update the imports and exports in all the affected files.
4.  Create a new `SPARQLStore.js` that will act as a facade and compose the different modules.
5.  Update the rest of the application to use the new `SPARQLStore.js` facade.

This refactoring will result in a more modular and maintainable codebase. It will also make it easier to test the different parts of the SPARQL store in isolation.
