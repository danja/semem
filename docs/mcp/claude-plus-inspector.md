## MCP Inspector and MCP Server Integration for Claude Code

**Summary:**  
Yes, there is an MCP Inspector server tool that allows you to run and test MCP servers—including those intended for use with Claude Code. This tool is specifically designed for developers to visually inspect, debug, and interact with MCP server implementations before connecting them to AI assistants like Claude.

**MCP Inspector Overview**

- The MCP Inspector is a developer tool for testing and debugging MCP servers, providing both a backend proxy and a frontend UI for interactive inspection[1][2][3].
- It can be run directly from the command line using `npx`, so you don’t need to install it globally[1][2][3].
- The Inspector launches both:
  - An MCP Inspector client UI (default: http://localhost:6274)
  - An MCP Proxy server (default: port 6277)[1][2].

**How to Run MCP Inspector**

- To start the Inspector in UI mode:
  ```
  npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
  ```
  This command starts the Inspector server and opens the UI in your browser at `http://localhost:6274`[1][2].

- To inspect a specific MCP server implementation (for example, your custom server):
  ```
  npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/index.js
  ```
  Replace `node build/index.js` with the command to start your MCP server. You can also pass arguments and environment variables as needed[1][2].

- For Python or other languages:
  ```
  npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector python main.py
  ```
  Or use the appropriate command for your server binary[4][3].

**Integration with Claude Code**

- Claude Code itself can act as an MCP server, making its tools available to any MCP client, including the Inspector[5].
- To run Claude Code as an MCP server:
  ```
  claude mcp serve
  ```
  This exposes Claude's tools (View, Edit, LS, etc.) to MCP clients[5].

- You can connect the Inspector to Claude Code’s MCP server endpoint to test and debug tool availability and behavior before integrating with other clients (like Claude Desktop)[1][2][3].

**Typical Workflow**

1. **Develop your MCP server** (in Node.js, Python, Java, etc.).
2. **Run MCP Inspector** to test your server locally:
   - Inspector will show you the available tools, allow you to invoke them, and debug responses.
3. **Once validated**, register your MCP server with Claude Desktop or another MCP client for live use[6][7].

**Troubleshooting**

- If your MCP server works in Inspector but not in Claude Desktop, the issue is likely with configuration or environment differences, not the Inspector itself[8].
- Inspector is ideal for isolating and debugging such issues before production integration.

| Feature                | MCP Inspector                       | Claude Code MCP Server           |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Purpose                | Debug/test any MCP server           | Expose Claude tools via MCP      |
| How to Run             | `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector` | `claude mcp serve`               |
| UI                     | Yes (web browser, default port 6274)| No (CLI/server only)             |
| Integration Target     | Any MCP server (custom or standard) | Any MCP client (Inspector, Desktop) |
| Typical Use            | Development, debugging, validation  | Tool provider for AI assistants  |

**In summary:**  
MCP Inspector is the recommended tool for running and testing MCP servers—including those you want to use as tools in Claude Code. You can run it locally via `npx`, point it at your server, and visually inspect all available tools and endpoints before connecting to production environments like Claude Desktop or Claude Code itself[1][2][3].
