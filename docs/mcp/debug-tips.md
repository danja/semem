To debug an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server effectively, follow these best practices and use the recommended tools:

## Key Debugging Approaches

- **Use MCP Inspector:** This is a cross-platform GUI/web tool maintained by the MCP team that allows you to connect to your MCP server via various transports (stdio, HTTP, TCP), send test requests, view responses, and inspect server logs (stderr) and notifications in real-time. It can also proxy the launch of your server for interactive debugging. Launch it with:
  ```
  npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node your-server.js
  ```
  or for Python servers:
  ```
  mcp dev server.py
  ```
  This tool is indispensable for verifying protocol conformance and tracing message flow[1][2][5].

- **Logging and Observability:**
  - Write all diagnostic logs, debug messages, and any non-protocol output to `stderr` only, as MCP communication uses `stdout` exclusively for JSON-RPC messages.
  - Use structured logging (JSON format) with fields like timestamp, level, serverName, method, requestId, message, and errorStack to facilitate parsing and analysis.
  - Prefix logs with context identifiers (e.g., server name, method) to trace requests and errors effectively.
  - Monitor both server logs and host logs (from clients like Claude Desktop or Copilot Studio) to understand client-server interactions and connection issues[5].

- **Validate JSON and Protocol Messages:**
  - Ensure your server outputs only valid JSON-RPC messages on `stdout`.
  - Use CLI tools like `jq` combined with echo commands to validate JSON schemas and test server responses interactively.
  - Test error handling by sending invalid or edge-case requests to your server and verify proper error responses[4][5].

- **Error Handling:**
  - Wrap tool/resource logic in try/catch blocks.
  - Log errors thoroughly to `stderr`.
  - Return valid JSON-RPC error responses instead of crashing.
  - Implement global error catching in Node.js (`process.on('uncaughtException')`) or Python (`loop.set_exception_handler`) to catch unexpected errors[5].

- **Connection and Transport Checks:**
  - Verify the server process is running.
  - Confirm transport configurations (stdio paths, HTTP ports) match between server and host.
  - Check for port conflicts or permission issues if connection errors occur (e.g., `ECONNREFUSED`, `EADDRINUSE`)[5][7].

- **Use SDK and Debugger Tools:**
  - For Node.js, use standard debugging tools like `node --inspect` and VS Code debugger alongside MCP Inspector.
  - For Python, use the `mcp` CLI tool to streamline development and debugging.
  - Utilize host developer tools like Claude Desktop's DevTools or Copilot Studio's debugging views to monitor MCP request/response logs and connection status[5].

## Summary

Combining the MCP Inspector tool with effective logging, JSON validation, error handling, and connection checks provides a robust framework for debugging MCP servers. Use CLI tools for quick tests and integrate with host developer tools to gain full visibility into client-server interactions. This systematic approach helps identify and resolve issues faster and ensures reliable MCP server implementations.
