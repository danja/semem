# ZPT (Zoom-Pan-Tilt) Navigation System

The ZPT navigation system provides a spatial metaphor for exploring knowledge spaces in Semem. It enables users to navigate corpus data at different levels of abstraction (zoom), filter by domains or topics (pan), and choose different analytical perspectives (tilt).

## Core Concepts

### Navigation Parameters

ZPT navigation operates using three primary parameters:

**Zoom**: Controls the level of abstraction for content selection:
- `entity` - Individual entities and stored interactions (default)
- `unit` - Semantic units and text passages  
- `text` - Raw text elements and fragments
- `community` - Topic clusters and concept groups
- `corpus` - Entire corpus view

**Pan**: Defines filtering and domain constraints:
- `domains` - Subject domain filters (comma-separated: "ai, science, technology")
- `keywords` - Keyword filters (comma-separated: "machine learning, neural")
- `concepts` - Concept-based filters using extracted concept labels
- Currently supports domain, keyword, and concept filtering through the workbench UI

**Tilt**: Selects the analytical projection method:
- `keywords` - Keyword-based analysis and matching (default)
- `embedding` - Vector similarity using embeddings
- `graph` - Graph structure and connectivity analysis  
- `temporal` - Time-based organization and sequencing
- `concept` - Concept-based analysis using RDF concept extraction
- `memory` - Memory-based perspective

### Ontology Integration

The system uses formal ZPT ontology URIs (`http://purl.org/stuff/zpt/`) instead of string literals:

- Navigation parameters are automatically converted from strings to ontology URIs
- All navigation metadata is stored as RDF triples using SPARQL
- Provenance tracking uses W3C PROV-O for complete audit trails
- Cross-graph queries enable integration with corpus data

## Workbench Integration

### Navigate Column in Workbench UI

The ZPT system is integrated into the Semantic Memory Workbench through a dedicated "Navigate" column that provides interactive controls for all three navigation dimensions.

#### Current ZPT State Display
At the top of the Navigate column, the current ZPT state is shown in the format:
```
ZPT: entity / all / keywords
```
This displays your current zoom level, pan filters, and tilt perspective.

#### Interactive Controls

**Zoom Controls (üîç Abstraction Level)**:
- **Entity** (default): Shows individual stored interactions and entities from your knowledge base
- **Unit**: Displays semantic units and text passages
- **Text**: Shows raw text elements and fragments  
- **Community**: Displays topic clusters and concept groups
- **Corpus**: Shows entire corpus view

**Similarity Threshold Slider (üìä)**:
- Range: 0.0 (Broad) to 1.0 (Precise)
- Default: 0.3
- Controls how similar content must be to be included in results
- Lower values = more results, potentially less relevant
- Higher values = fewer results, more precisely matched

**Pan Controls (üéØ Domain Filters)**:
- **Domains**: Enter comma-separated domain filters (e.g., "ai, science, technology")
- **Keywords**: Enter comma-separated keyword filters (e.g., "machine learning, neural")
- Changes apply automatically with 500ms debounce

**Tilt Controls (üëÅÔ∏è View Style)**:
- **Keywords** (default): Keyword-based analysis and matching
- **Embedding**: Vector similarity using embeddings
- **Graph**: Graph structure and connectivity analysis
- **Temporal**: Time-based organization and sequencing
- **Concept**: Concept-based analysis using RDF concept extraction  
- **Memory**: Memory-based perspective

#### Navigation Execution

Click the **"Execute Navigation"** button (üß≠) to run the ZPT navigation with your current settings. Results appear in the navigation results area showing:

- **Current Perspective**: Summary of active zoom/pan/tilt settings
- **Navigation Results**: Content matching your ZPT parameters
- **Result Metadata**: Count of items found, similarity scores, etc.

### Usage Tips

**Getting Started**:
1. Start with default settings (entity/keywords) to see your stored content
2. Use the similarity threshold to fine-tune result relevance
3. Add domain or keyword filters to narrow results
4. Switch tilt modes to see different analytical perspectives

**Common Workflows**:
- **Broad Exploration**: Use corpus zoom with low similarity threshold
- **Focused Search**: Use entity zoom with high similarity threshold and specific keywords
- **Conceptual Analysis**: Use concept tilt with medium similarity threshold for RDF-based concept extraction
- **Semantic Analysis**: Use embedding tilt with medium similarity threshold for vector-based similarity
- **Topic Discovery**: Use community zoom with keyword filters
- **Concept Discovery**: Use concept tilt with entity zoom to extract and analyze conceptual relationships

**Performance Optimization**:
- Start with higher similarity thresholds and lower them if needed
- Use specific domain/keyword filters to reduce search space
- Entity and unit zoom levels are generally faster than community/corpus

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**No Results Found**:
- Lower the similarity threshold (try 0.1-0.2 for broad exploration)
- Remove domain/keyword filters to see all available content  
- Switch to entity zoom level to see stored interactions
- Check that you have content in your knowledge base using the Ask or Tell verbs first

**Too Many Results**:
- Increase similarity threshold (try 0.6-0.8 for precision)
- Add specific domain or keyword filters
- Use unit or text zoom levels for more granular content

**Slow Navigation**:
- Increase similarity threshold to reduce result set size
- Add pan filters to limit search space
- Use entity/unit zoom instead of community/corpus
- Check SPARQL endpoint performance

**Unexpected Results**:
- Verify your pan filters are correctly formatted (comma-separated)
- Try different tilt modes (embedding vs keywords) for different perspectives
- Check the Current Perspective display to confirm your settings
- Use the Inspect verb to examine available content types

### Advanced Usage Patterns

**Content Discovery Workflow**:
1. Start with corpus zoom + low threshold to understand available content
2. Switch to community zoom to identify topic clusters  
3. Drill down with entity zoom + specific filters
4. Use unit/text zoom for detailed content examination

**Comparative Analysis**:
1. Set specific domain filters (e.g., "machine learning")
2. Compare results across different tilt modes
3. Adjust similarity thresholds to find optimal balance
4. Use temporal tilt to see evolution of topics over time

**Quality Control**:
1. Use high similarity thresholds (0.7+) with entity zoom
2. Apply specific keyword filters for precision
3. Review results using embedding tilt for semantic coherence
4. Cross-reference with Ask verb for validation

## System Architecture

### Core Components

**CorpuscleSelector**: Main orchestrator for parameter-based content selection. Queries SPARQL store for entities matching zoom level (entities, interactions, etc.) and applies pan filtering.

**FilterBuilder**: Builds SPARQL queries from ZPT parameters. Handles union queries to search both `ragno:Entity` and `semem:Interaction` types for comprehensive results.

**CorpuscleTransformer**: Transforms selected corpuscles into display formats, handling token limits and content chunking.

**ParameterValidator**: Validates navigation parameters against supported values and combinations.

**ParameterNormalizer**: Converts string parameters to standardized internal representation.

### Data Flow

1. **UI Interaction**: User adjusts zoom, pan, and tilt controls in workbench Navigate column
2. **Parameter Collection**: System collects current ZPT state and user query
3. **SPARQL Query Building**: FilterBuilder creates appropriate SPARQL queries based on zoom level
4. **Content Selection**: CorpuscleSelector executes queries against SPARQL store
5. **Result Processing**: Selected content is filtered by similarity threshold and pan criteria  
6. **Content Transformation**: Results are formatted for display in workbench UI
7. **UI Update**: Navigation results and current perspective are updated

### Current Data Sources

The ZPT system currently queries:
- **semem:Interaction** entities (stored via `/tell` endpoint)
- **ragno:Entity** entities (from Ragno corpus processing)
- **ragno:Concept** entities (extracted via concept tilt functionality)
- **Concept relationships** stored as RDF triples with confidence scores
- **Embeddings** for similarity-based navigation
- **Metadata** for filtering and ranking

## Navigation Operations

### Basic Navigation

Navigation in the workbench starts with the Navigate column interface. The default query is "Navigate knowledge space" and users control perspective through the ZPT controls:

**Example Navigation Flow**:
1. Set zoom level to "entity" (default)
2. Add domain filters: "ai, machine learning" 
3. Set tilt to "embedding" for semantic similarity
4. Adjust similarity threshold to 0.5 for more precise matching
5. Click "Execute Navigation" to run the search

**API Usage** (for programmatic access):
```javascript
// Standard navigation with concept filtering
const result = await apiService.zptNavigate({
  query: "machine learning applications",
  zoom: "entity",
  pan: { 
    domains: "ai, tech", 
    keywords: "neural, algorithm",
    concepts: "machine learning, artificial intelligence"
  },
  tilt: "concept"
});

// Concept extraction and storage
const conceptResult = await apiService.zptNavigate({
  query: "Extract concepts from philosophical texts",
  zoom: "entity",
  pan: { domains: "philosophy" },
  tilt: "concept"  // Will extract and store concepts as ragno:Concept entities
});
```

### Zoom Level Behavior

Each zoom level queries different types of content from the SPARQL store:

**Entity Level** (Default):
- Queries both `ragno:Entity` and `semem:Interaction` types
- Includes stored interactions from `/tell` operations  
- Includes entities extracted from corpus processing
- Returns: URI, label, type, prefLabel, embedding, metadata
- Best for: Exploring specific concepts and stored knowledge

**Unit Level**:
- Queries `ragno:SemanticUnit` entities
- Focuses on semantic units and text passages
- Returns structured text segments with metadata
- Best for: Analyzing semantic chunks and passages

**Text Level**: 
- Queries `ragno:TextElement` entities
- Shows raw text fragments and elements
- Returns lowest-level text content
- Best for: Examining source text and detailed content

**Community Level**:
- Queries `ragno:Community` entities  
- Shows topic clusters and concept groups
- Returns community metadata and member relations
- Best for: Topic-based exploration and clustering analysis

**Corpus Level**:
- Queries `ragno:Corpus` entities
- Provides corpus-wide view and statistics
- Returns high-level corpus metadata
- Best for: Understanding overall content structure

### Selection Methods

**Keywords Tilt** (Default): Text-based matching using keyword extraction and frequency analysis. Scores content based on keyword overlap and term frequency.

**Embedding Tilt**: Vector similarity using embeddings. Generates query embeddings and calculates cosine similarity with stored content embeddings.

**Graph Tilt**: Graph structure analysis using connectivity metrics, centrality measures, and relationship analysis.

**Temporal Tilt**: Time-based organization using creation time, modification time, or temporal annotations.

**Concept Tilt**: RDF-based concept extraction and analysis using the ragno vocabulary. Extracts concepts from content, builds conceptual relationships, stores them as `ragno:Concept` entities in SPARQL, and provides concept-based navigation with confidence scoring and category organization.

**Memory Tilt**: Memory-based perspective incorporating relevance scoring and memory decay factors.

### Concept-Based Navigation

The ZPT system includes comprehensive RDF-based concept functionality that enables conceptual analysis and navigation:

**Concept Extraction**: Automatically extracts concepts from text content using LLM-based analysis and stores them as `ragno:Concept` entities in the SPARQL store.

**Concept Storage**: Concepts are stored with full RDF metadata including:
- **Labels and URIs**: Standardized concept identification using `http://purl.org/stuff/ragno/concept/` namespace
- **Confidence Scores**: Extraction confidence values for quality assessment
- **Categories**: Concept categorization (Philosophy, Science, Technology, etc.)  
- **Relationships**: Conceptual relationships between related concepts
- **Provenance**: Source entity tracking and temporal metadata

**Concept Filtering**: Advanced pan filtering strategies using concept data:
- **Direct Filtering**: Match corpuscles containing specific concept labels
- **Categorical Filtering**: Filter by concept categories (e.g., "Philosophy", "Science")
- **Relational Filtering**: Include content related to target concepts through relationships
- **Similarity Filtering**: Use semantic similarity between concepts with configurable thresholds

**Concept Tilt Projection**: When using concept tilt, the system:
1. Extracts concepts from selected corpuscles using LLM analysis
2. Builds concept maps with relationships and confidence scores
3. Stores concepts as RDF entities in SPARQL with full metadata
4. Returns structured concept data including statistics and categorization

**API Methods**: Programmatic concept access through SPARQLStore:
- `storeConcepts(concepts, sourceEntityUri)` - Store extracted concepts as RDF entities
- `storeConceptRelationships(relationships)` - Store conceptual relationships
- `queryConceptsByFilter(filters)` - Query concepts by category, confidence, or relationships

### Cross-Zoom Navigation

The system supports navigation across different abstraction levels within the same session. Users can move from entity-level analysis to unit-level detail or corpus-level overview while maintaining context and session continuity.

Navigation views track zoom level changes and enable analysis of user exploration patterns. This supports optimization of navigation interfaces and understanding of effective knowledge discovery strategies.

### Caching and Performance

The system implements multi-level caching:
- Parameter-based result caching with configurable expiry
- Navigation metadata caching for frequently accessed patterns  
- SPARQL query result caching for performance optimization

Cache keys are generated from normalized parameter representations to ensure consistent cache hits across equivalent navigation requests.

## RDF Storage and Provenance

### Navigation Sessions

Navigation sessions represent user or agent exploration activities. Sessions include:
- Session URI and temporal metadata
- Associated agent information
- Purpose and context description
- PROV-O provenance relationships

### Navigation Views

Navigation views capture specific navigation operations within sessions:
- Query and parameter specifications
- Selected corpuscle collections
- Zoom, pan, and tilt state objects
- Optimization scores and effectiveness metrics

### SPARQL Integration

Navigation metadata is stored using SPARQL INSERT operations in dedicated named graphs. The system generates RDF quads from navigation objects and executes batch INSERT operations for efficiency.

Cross-graph queries enable integration between navigation metadata and corpus content, supporting analysis of navigation patterns and content relationships.
