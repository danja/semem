# ZPT (Zoom-Pan-Tilt) Navigation Exercises

This document outlines comprehensive exercises for testing the ZPT (Zoom-Pan-Tilt) navigation system in Semem. ZPT allows users to navigate semantic memory at different levels of abstraction (Zoom), filter by domains/keywords (Pan), and adjust viewing perspectives (Tilt).

## Understanding ZPT Navigation

ZPT navigation is like using a semantic telescope to explore knowledge:

- **Zoom**: Controls the level of abstraction (molecular → entity → concept → theme)
- **Pan**: Filters content by specific domains or keywords (like pointing the telescope)
- **Tilt**: Changes the viewing perspective (keywords, entities, relationships, temporal)

## Exercise Set 1: Basic Zoom Navigation
