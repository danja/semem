## Introduction

ZPT (Zoom, Pan, Tilt) provides a revolutionary approach to knowledge graph navigation by treating information as a 3-dimensional space that can be explored using intuitive camera-like controls. Unlike traditional search interfaces, ZPT allows you to cinematically navigate through knowledge, adjusting your level of detail, filtering scope, and representation style in real-time.

- **Multi-Dimensional Control**: Simultaneous control over detail level, scope, and style
- **Intelligent Content Selection**: Multiple AI strategies for finding relevant information
- **Token-Aware Processing**: Optimized for LLM consumption with adaptive chunking
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with Semem's memory and knowledge graph systems

### Key Benefits

- **Intuitive Exploration**: Natural navigation using familiar camera concepts
- **Adaptive Detail**: Automatically adjusts information density to your needs
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains coherent perspective throughout navigation
- **Efficient Discovery**: Quickly find relevant information in large knowledge bases
- **Flexible Output**: Choose representation style that fits your use case

## Understanding ZPT Navigation

### The Three Dimensions

#### Zoom: Level of Abstraction
Controls how detailed or abstract your view is:

- **Entity**: Focus on individual entities and their properties
- **Unit**: Balanced view of semantic units with related entities
- **Text**: Broader view including detailed textual content
- **Community**: Topic-level clusters and domain overviews
- **Corpus**: Highest level patterns across entire knowledge base

#### Pan: Content Filtering
Controls what content is included in your view:

- **Temporal Filtering**: Focus on specific time periods or chronological progression
- **Geographic Filtering**: Limit to location-specific content
- **Topic Filtering**: Focus on specific subject areas or themes
- **Entity Filtering**: Focus on specific organizations, people, or concepts

#### Tilt: Representation Style
Controls how content is represented and presented:

- **Keywords**: Term-based representation (fastest processing)
- **Embedding**: Vector-based semantic similarity representation
- **Graph**: Relationship-based network representation
- **Temporal**: Time-based sequential representation

### Navigation Philosophy

ZPT treats knowledge exploration as a journey through information space where you can:

- **Zoom in** for detailed analysis of specific entities
- **Zoom out** for broader thematic understanding
- **Pan** to shift focus to different domains or time periods
- **Tilt** to change perspective from technical to conversational
- **Combine dimensions** for sophisticated multi-faceted exploration
