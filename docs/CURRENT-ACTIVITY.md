# Current Activity

Increased human intervention!

Mostly getting things into a more finished state. Debugging, rationalizing.

There are many components that seem to work in isolation, but experimentation is needed to see how they can best be used in workflows. Using MCP in a Claude Code session, Claude does quite a good job of following a sequence.

(My long-term plan is to run workflows using [Transmissions](https://github.com/danja/transmissions), calling the HTTP API).

## Core

The ZPT functionality has been roughly scaffolded, but isn't yet live against SPARQL data
docs/zpt/PLAN.md

## HTTP API

Need to find out which pieces of functionality aren't yet exposed - and expose them.

## MCP

There are about 60 tools, it seems likely that only a fraction of these are worth exposing over MCP. Many will be buggy and suboptimal for their intended use.

## UI
