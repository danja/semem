# SPARQL Storage Implementation Handover

## Overview
Implementation of persistent storage for the Memory Context Protocol (MCP) using SPARQL and RDF. The storage system uses named graphs for memory isolation and implements ACID transactions through graph backups.

## Core Components

### SPARQLStore
- Extends BaseStore for SPARQL endpoint interaction
- Uses named graphs for memory storage
- Implements transaction support through graph backups
- Supports both basic and federated queries

### CachedSPARQLStore
- Extends SPARQLStore with caching functionality
- Implements LRU cache with TTL for query results
- Handles cache invalidation during updates
- Includes automatic cache cleanup

## Data Model

### Core Vocabularies Used
- MCP (http://purl.org/stuff/mcp/): Core memory protocol concepts
- Data Cube (http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#): Statistical data structures
- SKOS (http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#): Concept relationships

### Graph Structure
- Main Memory Graph: Stores current memory state
- Backup Graph: Used for transaction management
- Metadata Graph: Stores version information and statistics

## Implementation Details

### Transaction Management
1. Begin Transaction: Creates backup graph copy
2. Operations: Performed on main graph
3. Commit: Removes backup graph
4. Rollback: Restores from backup graph

### Query Federation
- Cross-graph queries for metadata integration
- SERVICE keyword usage for endpoint federation
- Performance optimization through caching

### Backup Strategy
- Full graph copying for transactions
- Incremental updates tracking
- Corruption detection and recovery
- Concurrent access protection

## Testing

### Core Tests
- Basic storage operations
- Transaction management
- Query federation
- Cache performance

### Integration Tests
- Basic backup operations
- Advanced backup scenarios 
- Federation patterns
- Large dataset handling

## Configuration

### SPARQL Endpoints
- Query endpoint: /test/query
- Update endpoint: /test/update
- Graph store protocol: /test/get

### Authentication
- Basic auth supported
- Credentials in Config.js
- Connection pooling recommended

## Known Limitations
1. Large dataset performance requires caching
2. No built-in compression
3. Single endpoint backup only
4. Basic auth only

## Future Improvements
1. Backup compression
2. Multi-endpoint replication
3. Advanced authentication
4. Query optimization
5. Backup versioning
6. SHACL validation

## Critical Notes
- Always use transactions for updates
- Monitor backup graph cleanup
- Handle concurrent access
- Verify data integrity

## Dependencies
- Node.js fetch API
- SPARQL 1.1 endpoint
- Graph store protocol support
