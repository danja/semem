# Current Testing State - Mid-Implementation

## Status Summary
Currently in the middle of implementing comprehensive testing for the ChatGPT-style memory management system. Work was interrupted to address a critical SPARQL query parsing error.

## Completed Work
‚úÖ **Memory Management Components Implementation**
- Created `MemoryDomainManager` and `MemoryRelevanceEngine` classes (in `/src/services/memory/`)
- Enhanced `PanDomainFilter` with domain hierarchy support
- Added 5 new MCP verbs for memory operations: `remember`, `forget`, `recall`, `project_context`, `fade_memory`
- Created workbench UI components (`MemoryComponent.js`, `memory-components.css`, `memory-demo.html`)
- Enhanced `ApiService.js` with memory management API methods

‚úÖ **Testing Infrastructure Created**
- **Playwright E2E Tests**: `tests/ui/e2e/memory-management.e2e.js` - Comprehensive UI testing
- **Integration Tests**: `tests/integration/memory-management-workflows.test.js` - MCP verb workflows
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - `tests/unit/services/memory/MemoryDomainManager.test.js`
  - `tests/unit/services/memory/MemoryRelevanceEngine.test.js`

## Current Testing Issues
‚ö†Ô∏è **In Progress - Unit Test Fixes**
- MemoryDomainManager tests: 3 failed / 28 passed (relevance calculation mock issues)
- MemoryRelevanceEngine tests: 9 failed / 20 passed (mock behavior inconsistencies)
- Was updating mock implementations to be more realistic when interrupted

## Critical SPARQL Error Discovered
üö® **Urgent Issue**: SPARQL query parsing failure in document ingestion
- Error: "Parse error: Lexical error at line 21, column 11. Encountered: <EOF> after prefix 'null'"
- Location: `SPARQLDocumentIngester.js:142:19`
- Cause: Mistake made when changing limit part of queries to allow ingestion of every document
- This is blocking document ingestion functionality

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix SPARQL query parsing error in `SPARQLDocumentIngester.js`
2. **THEN**: Complete unit test fixes by using real SPARQL store instead of mocks (as suggested)
3. **THEN**: Run integration and Playwright tests to verify full system functionality

## Architecture Notes
The memory system follows the "navigation over deletion" principle with:
- Domain-based organization (user/project/session/instruction)
- Multi-factor relevance scoring (semantic/temporal/domain/frequency)
- ZPT navigation paradigm integration
- ChatGPT-style memory operations

## Files Modified During This Session
- `/src/services/memory/MemoryDomainManager.js` (created)
- `/src/services/memory/MemoryRelevanceEngine.js` (created)
- `/src/zpt/selection/PanDomainFilter.js` (enhanced)

- `/mcp/index.js` (enhanced)
- `/src/frontend/workbench/public/js/components/MemoryComponent.js` (created)
- `/src/frontend/workbench/public/styles/memory-components.css` (created)
- `/src/frontend/workbench/public/memory-demo.html` (created)
- `/src/frontend/workbench/public/js/services/ApiService.js` (enhanced)
- All test files listed above (created)
