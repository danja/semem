# BeerQA NodeRAG Integration Plan

**Status**: üöß In Progress  
**Started**: 2025-06-29  
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-29  

## Overview

This document tracks the integration of NodeRAG algorithms from `src/ragno/algorithms/` into the BeerQA workflow at `examples/beerqa/`. The goal is to enhance question answering quality through sophisticated graph analytics while preserving existing code and maximizing RDF structure usage.

## Analysis Summary

After reviewing the early documentation in `docs/ragno/noderag_algorithms_ragno.md` and the current state of the codebase, we've identified significant opportunities to enhance the BeerQA workflow with the existing Ragno algorithms. The current BeerQA workflow has basic similarity search and ZPT navigation, but lacks the sophisticated graph analytics that could dramatically improve question answering quality.

## Current BeerQA Workflow Limitations

### 1. **DiscoverTargets.js** - Basic Similarity Only
- **Current**: Cosine similarity (0.3 threshold) + concept matching (0.4 threshold)
- **Limitation**: Only finds lexically/semantically similar content, misses structurally important entities
- **Max Targets**: 15 per question

### 2. **Navigate.js** - Simple ZPT Navigation  
- **Current**: Fixed parameters (6 max corpuscles, 0.3 similarity)
- **Limitation**: No multi-hop traversal, misses related content through graph relationships

### 3. **GetResult.js** - Basic Context Assembly
- **Current**: Simple concatenation (5 context window, 4000 tokens, 2000 char markdown truncation)
- **Limitation**: No semantic organization of context, potential information overload

### 4. **QuestionResearch.js** - Limited Search Strategy
- **Current**: Wikipedia search (3 results per concept) + HyDE fallback (3 attempts)
- **Limitation**: No graph-guided search, may miss important but indirect content

## Key Integration Points

### 1. **Enhanced Target Discovery**
- **Enhancement**: K-core decomposition + betweenness centrality for entity ranking
- **Benefit**: Find structurally important Wikipedia entities, not just similar ones

### 2. **Intelligent Navigation** 
- **Enhancement**: Personalized PageRank (PPR) for multi-hop traversal
- **Benefit**: Discover related content through graph relationships

### 3. **Community-Aware Context Building**
- **Enhancement**: Community detection for hierarchical context organization
- **Benefit**: Better organized, more comprehensive context for LLM generation

### 4. **Graph-Enhanced Research**
- **Enhancement**: Dual search (exact + semantic) with graph analytics
- **Benefit**: More targeted Wikipedia searches based on centrality metrics

## Implementation Plan

### üèóÔ∏è Phase 1: Foundation Scripts

- [x] Handle incremental graph updates
- [x] **TESTED**: Successfully extracts 104 corpuscles, 18 attributes, builds 591 RDF triples

## Technical Principles

### ‚úÖ 1. Preserve Existing Code
- All new scripts in separate directories (`ragno/`, `enhanced/`, `workflows/`)
- Existing workflow scripts remain unchanged
- New scripts extend, not replace, current functionality
- Backward compatibility maintained throughout

### ‚úÖ 2. Maximize RDF Structure Usage
- All graph operations use RDF-Ext datasets
- Preserve ragno ontology compliance throughout
- Export all algorithm results as proper RDF triples
- Leverage existing SPARQL store for persistence

### ‚úÖ 3. SPARQL Store Integration
- Graph analytics results stored as ragno:Attribute nodes
- Community assignments stored as ragno:Community collections
- PPR scores stored as relationship weights
- All data queryable via existing SPARQL infrastructure

## Configuration Schema

### New Configuration Options
```json
{
  "ragno": {
    "graphAnalytics": {
      "enableKCore": true,
      "enableCentrality": true,
      "maxGraphSize": 1000,
      "cacheResults": true
    },
    "communityDetection": {
      "algorithm": "leiden",
      "resolution": 1.0,
      "minCommunitySize": 3
    },
    "personalizedPageRank": {
      "alpha": 0.15,
      "shallowIterations": 2,
      "deepIterations": 10,
      "topKPerType": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "enhancedMode": false,
      "fallbackToBaseline": true,
      "compareResults": false
    }
  }
}
```

## Expected Benefits

1. **Higher Quality Targets**: Graph structure identifies truly important entities, not just lexically similar ones
2. **Better Navigation**: Multi-hop PPR discovers related content through semantic relationships
3. **Organized Context**: Community-based grouping provides more coherent context for LLM generation
4. **Scalable Analytics**: Pre-computed graph metrics support fast real-time question answering
5. **Research Integration**: Graph-guided Wikipedia search focuses on structurally relevant content
