Currently the UI has a crude console log at the bottom of the screen. More of the available screen should be used for the main panel of the UI in view, with the console as a pull-out to the right of screen, with a drop-down list of the loglevel to use. (Some parts of the system currently use direct console.log calls, which should be replaced with loglevel calls.) 
The console should be created with best practices in mind, favoring code reuse and modularity, and should be easy to use and navigate. It MUST NOT break existing code.
