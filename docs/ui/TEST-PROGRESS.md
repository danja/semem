# UI Testing Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of UI testing for the Semem application, including test setup, identified issues, and test coverage.

## Test Environment
- **Testing Framework**: Playwright
- **Browsers**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit
- **Test Runner**: Playwright Test
- **Date Started**: 2025-06-17

## Test Setup

### Dependencies Installed
- [x] Playwright Test
- [x] Playwright Browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)

### Configuration
- [x] Basic Playwright configuration
- [x] Test directory structure
- [x] CI/CD integration (basic setup)

## Test Coverage

### Console Component
- [x] Basic smoke test
- [ ] Toggle visibility
- [ ] Log level filtering
- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Pause/Resume logging
- [ ] Clear logs
- [ ] Copy to clipboard

### VSOM Visualization
- [ ] Basic rendering
- [ ] Interactive features
- [ ] Data loading
- [ ] Error states

## Identified Issues

1. **Console Toggle Not Found**
   - **Status**: Resolved
   - **Description**: Debug test revealed that the console toggle button doesn't exist in the current UI. The UI has a different structure than expected.
   - **Findings**:
     - The application has multiple tabs (Query, Graph, Edit RDF, Endpoints)
     - Main functional areas include SPARQL query execution, graph visualization, and RDF editing
     - No direct console toggle button found in the current UI

2. **Test Coverage Mismatch**
   - **Status**: Identified
   - **Description**: Current test cases don't match the actual UI structure
   - **Next Steps**:
     - Update test cases to match actual UI components
     - Add tests for SPARQL query execution
     - Add tests for graph visualization
     - Add tests for RDF editing

## Test Execution

### 2025-06-17
- Set up Playwright testing environment
- Created basic smoke test (PASSED)
- Created console component tests (FAILING - element not found)
- Added debug test to investigate page structure
- Debug test revealed actual UI structure and available components
- Identified need to update test strategy to match actual application features

## Next Steps
1. Update test strategy to match actual UI components:
   - SPARQL query execution
   - Graph visualization
   - RDF editing
   - Endpoint management
2. Create page objects for main UI components
3. Add tests for core functionality
4. Implement visual regression testing
5. Set up test reporting and CI/CD integration

## Test Reports

### Latest Run
```
Test Suites: 1 failed, 1 passed, 2 total
Tests:       6 failed, 3 passed, 9 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        1.1m
```

## Notes
- Tests are currently failing due to selector issues
- Need to investigate the actual page structure
- Consider adding test IDs to make tests more robust
