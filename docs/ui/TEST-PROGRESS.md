# UI Testing Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of UI testing for the Semem application, including test setup, identified issues, and test coverage.

## Test Environment
- **Testing Framework**: Playwright
- **Browsers**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit
- **Test Runner**: Playwright Test
- **Date Started**: 2025-06-17

## Test Setup

### Dependencies Installed
- [x] Playwright Test
- [x] Playwright Browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)

### Configuration
- [x] Basic Playwright configuration
- [x] Test directory structure
- [x] CI/CD integration (basic setup)

## Test Coverage

### Console Component
- [x] Basic smoke test
- [ ] Toggle visibility
- [ ] Log level filtering
- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Pause/Resume logging
- [ ] Clear logs
- [ ] Copy to clipboard

### VSOM Visualization
- [ ] Basic rendering
- [ ] Interactive features
- [ ] Data loading
- [ ] Error states

## Identified Issues

1. **UI Interaction Issues**
   - **Status**: Investigating
   - **Description**: Tests are failing due to element interaction problems
   - **Findings**:
     - Elements are present in the DOM but not visible/interactable
     - May need to wait for specific conditions before interacting
     - Possible iframes or shadow DOM affecting element selection

2. **Tab Navigation Problems**
   - **Status**: Investigating
   - **Description**: Unable to reliably switch between tabs in the UI
   - **Next Steps**:
     - Add more robust waiting for tab content to load
     - Verify tab selection mechanism
     - Consider direct URL navigation for tab switching

3. **Test Stability**
   - **Status**: Addressing
   - **Description**: Tests are flaky and time out frequently
   - **Improvements Needed**:
     - Implement better element waiting strategies
     - Add retry logic for flaky tests
     - Increase timeouts where necessary

## Test Execution

### 2025-06-17
- Set up Playwright testing environment
- Created basic smoke test (PASSED)
- Created console component tests (FAILING - element not found)
- Added debug test to investigate page structure
- Debug test revealed actual UI structure and available components
- Created SPARQL page object and test cases
- Identified UI interaction issues with tab navigation

## Next Steps

1. **Improve Test Reliability**
   - Add explicit waits for element visibility/clickability
   - Implement retry logic for flaky tests
   - Add more detailed error logging

2. **Debug Tab Navigation**
   - Investigate why tab clicks aren't working as expected
   - Try alternative selectors or interaction methods
   - Consider direct URL navigation for tab switching

3. **Enhance Test Coverage**
   - Once basic navigation works, proceed with testing:
     - SPARQL query execution
     - Graph visualization
     - RDF editing
     - Endpoint management

4. **Infrastructure**
   - Set up test reporting
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline
   - Add visual regression testing

## Test Reports

### Latest Run
```
Test Suites: 1 failed, 1 passed, 2 total
Tests:       6 failed, 3 passed, 9 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        1.1m
```

## Notes
- Tests are currently failing due to selector issues
- Need to investigate the actual page structure
- Consider adding test IDs to make tests more robust
