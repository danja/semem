Semem uses Vitest for unit testing and integration testing. File naming and dir structure should follow conventions and be consistent with the rest of the codebase. Currently there are many tests that fail, but at this point in time it is likely that most failures are due to the tests themselves being out of date rather than problems with target code, so assume the underlying code works.
The demos under examples/ should all work, they are in effect integration tests. The parts of the system they address should be treated as priority to maintain their functionality and Vitest unit and integration tests should be created for them. Coverage should be periodically checked. Keep a record of progress in docs/test/TEST-PROGRESS.md
There are also a series of tests named test-*.js in the root directory. Any useful functionality in them should be lifted into proper Vitest tests and the root tests should be removed.
