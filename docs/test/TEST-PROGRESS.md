# Test Progress Tracker

## Current Status (2025-06-17)

### Test Infrastructure

- [x] Set up Playwright for end-to-end tests
- [x] Separate test directories for unit, integration, and e2e tests
- [x] Configured test scripts in package.json
- [x] Added test coverage reporting

### Test Coverage
- [ ] Core functionality
- [ ] API endpoints
- [ ] UI components
- [ ] Integration points

## Test Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Root Test Files Migration
Migrate test-*.js files from root directory to proper test directories:

1. **High Priority** (Core functionality):
   - [x] `test-sparql-connection.js` → `tests/integration/sparql/connection.spec.js` (2025-06-17)
   - [ ] `test-sparql-storage.js` → `tests/integration/storage/sparql.spec.js`
   - [ ] `test-mcp.js` → `tests/integration/mcp/mcp.spec.js`

2. **Medium Priority** (UI/API):
   - [ ] `test-chat-api.js` → `tests/integration/api/chat.spec.js`
   - [ ] `test-chat-interface.js` → `tests/e2e/chat-interface.e2e.js`
   - [ ] `test-graph-visualization.js` → `tests/e2e/graph-visualization.e2e.js`
   - [ ] `test-memory-visualization.js` → `tests/e2e/memory-visualization.e2e.js`

3. **Low Priority** (Scripts and Utilities):
   - [ ] `test-attribute-generation.js` → `tests/unit/services/attribute-generation.test.js`
   - [ ] `test-real-llm-attribute-generation.js` → `tests/integration/services/llm-attribute-generation.spec.js`
   - [ ] `test-script.js` → `tests/unit/scripts/script.test.js`

### Phase 2: Example-Based Tests
Create tests based on working examples:

1. **Basic Examples** (`/examples/basic`):
   - [ ] Test basic setup and initialization
   - [ ] Test core functionality demonstrated in examples

2. **RAG Examples** (`/examples/ragno`):
   - [ ] Test RAG pipeline
   - [ ] Test document ingestion and retrieval

3. **ZPT Examples** (`/examples/zpt`):
   - [ ] Test ZPT functionality
   - [ ] Test template processing

### Phase 3: UI/UX Testing
- [ ] Test all UI components
- [ ] Test user flows
- [ ] Test accessibility
- [ ] Test responsive design

## Test Execution

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run e2e tests
npm run test:e2e

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Results

### Integration Tests Status

#### Working Tests
- [x] SPARQL Connection - Basic connectivity tests passing (2025-06-17)
- [x] SPARQL Endpoint - Basic query functionality working
- [x] WebSocket Integration - Basic connectivity confirmed

#### Needs Attention
- [ ] SPARQL Storage - Configuration issues found
  - Endpoint configuration not properly loaded
  - Need to check config structure
- [ ] MCP Integration - Multiple test failures
  - Memory management issues
  - Test expectations may be outdated
- [ ] LLM Handler - Multiple test failures
  - Test assertions need updating
  - Some test utilities missing (expectAsync)
  - Mock implementations needed

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Core functionality
- [ ] API endpoints
- [ ] Services

### E2E Tests
- [ ] UI components
- [ ] User flows

### Coverage
- [ ] Current coverage: TBD%
- [ ] Target coverage: 80%

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix SPARQL Storage Tests**
   - Update test configuration to match actual storage setup
   - Add proper endpoint configuration handling
   - Consider mocking for CI environments

2. **Update Test Assertions**
   - Replace deprecated matchers (toBeTrue -> toBe(true))
   - Update test expectations to match current behavior
   - Add proper error handling

3. **Improve Test Isolation**
   - Add proper setup/teardown for each test
   - Use mocks for external services
   - Ensure tests don't depend on shared state

### Medium Term
1. **Enhance Test Coverage**
   - Focus on core functionality first
   - Add tests for critical paths
   - Improve error case coverage

2. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing
   - Add test result reporting
   - Implement code coverage reporting

3. **Documentation**
   - Document test patterns and best practices
   - Add test setup instructions
   - Document known issues and workarounds
