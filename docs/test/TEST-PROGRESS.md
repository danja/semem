## Test Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Root Test Files Migration
Migrate test-*.js files from root directory to proper test directories:

1. **High Priority** (Core functionality):
   - [x] `test-sparql-connection.js` → `tests/integration/sparql/connection.spec.js` (2025-06-17)
   - [x] `test-sparql-storage.js` → `tests/integration/storage/sparql.spec.js` (2025-06-17)
   - [x] `test-mcp.js` → `tests/integration/mcp/mcp.spec.js` (2025-06-17)

2. **Medium Priority** (UI/API):
   - [x] `test-chat-api.js` → `tests/integration/api/chat.spec.js` (2025-06-17)
   - [x] `test-chat-interface.js` → `tests/e2e/chat-interface.e2e.js` (2025-06-17)
   - [x] `test-graph-visualization.js` → `tests/e2e/graph-visualization.e2e.js` (2025-06-17)
   - [x] `test-memory-visualization.js` → `tests/e2e/memory-visualization.e2e.js` (2025-06-17)

3. **Low Priority** (Scripts and Utilities):
   - [ ] `test-attribute-generation.js` → `tests/unit/services/attribute-generation.test.js`
   - [ ] `test-real-llm-attribute-generation.js` → `tests/integration/services/llm-attribute-generation.spec.js`
   - [ ] `test-script.js` → `tests/unit/scripts/script.test.js`

### Phase 2: Example-Based Tests
Create tests based on working examples:

1. **Basic Examples** (`/examples/basic`):
   - [ ] Test basic setup and initialization
   - [ ] Test core functionality demonstrated in examples

2. **RAG Examples** (`/examples/ragno`):
   - [ ] Test RAG pipeline
   - [ ] Test document ingestion and retrieval

3. **ZPT Examples** (`/examples/zpt`):
   - [ ] Test ZPT functionality
   - [ ] Test template processing

### Phase 3: UI/UX Testing
- [ ] Test all UI components
- [ ] Test user flows
- [ ] Test accessibility
- [ ] Test responsive design
