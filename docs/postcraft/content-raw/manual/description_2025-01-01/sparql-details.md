# SPARQL Integration in Semem

The SPARQL integration in Semem provides a sophisticated semantic storage layer that enables rich querying and knowledge graph capabilities. The system uses a carefully designed RDF schema to represent memories and their relationships.

## Core Schema
Memories are stored using a custom vocabulary:
```turtle
@prefix mcp: <http://purl.org/stuff/mcp/>

mcp:Interaction 
    a rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Memory Interaction" .

mcp:embedding
    a rdf:Property ;
    rdfs:domain mcp:Interaction ;
    rdfs:range xsd:string .
```

## Transaction Management
The SPARQLStore implements ACID transactions through:
1. Automatic backup creation before transactions
2. Graph-level locking for concurrent access
3. Rollback capability using backup graphs
4. Transaction isolation through separate graph contexts

## Caching Layer
The CachedSPARQLStore extends functionality with:
1. In-memory query result caching
2. Automatic cache invalidation on updates
3. Time-based cache expiration
4. Size-limited LRU caching strategy

## Federation Support
The system supports federated queries across multiple endpoints, enabling:
1. Distributed memory storage
2. Cross-graph concept relationships
3. Metadata management in separate graphs
4. Scalable memory organization
