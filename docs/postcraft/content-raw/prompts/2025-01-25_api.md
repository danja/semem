I'd like you to help move forward the API implementation in the `src/api` directory.

Base infrastructure is solid with BaseAPI and APIRegistry providing core functionality
HTTP looks mostly done, but CLI and REPL API handlers only have skeleton implementations
Critical services like error handling, metrics, and authentication need completion

Next steps :

## Feature Handlers

* ActiveHandler: Missing concept mapping and semantic search
* PassiveHandler: Incomplete caching and transaction support
* SelfieHandler: Metrics collection needs implementation

## API
* CLI Integration
* REPL Integration
* Command parsing incomplete
* History management
* No interactive completion

## Docs
* Swagger/OpenAPI docs need completion
