# Zoom, Pan and Tilt (and Lights?)

Time I got this notebook on the road before I forget everything... I have loads of notes related to #:semem scattered around, but the irony is that I need #:semem to organise them. I'll likely be repeating myself if I start writing comprehensively from scratch. But I know I have progress some ideas, so maybe a bit of braindumping - at minimum it might provide me with reminders.

I think it will be useful to use borrow some terms from cinematography in knowledge management. (I think I did a little braindump to this to danbri - Signal or Twitter DM?)

abstraction, scope, aspect

The knowledge base is the #:Universe, as used in logic. Mine, for current purposes with include  everything from local personal notes through project notes to the Web (especially semweb).

* #:Zoom for the level of detail/abstraction
* #:Pan for scope, domain
* #:Tilt for the mix of layers (*a more literal analogy would be optical filters, but tilt lives with the two other terms which I'm redefining*).

#:lingue = Lingue Franche, inter-agent messaging language

Zoom will take advantage of summarization in different dimensions, at multiple scales.
