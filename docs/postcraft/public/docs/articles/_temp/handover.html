    <p>I also throw in docs of ORM documentation or the output of <code>tree</code> to help give a little more context</p>
<p>Efficient handover documentation always has to contain these elements (or a similar variation of them):</p>
<ol>
<li>A clearly defined scope of duties and responsibilities
First and foremost, the successor needs to have a full list of the daily tasks, activities, and responsibilities of the job role they’re taking over. These can vary depending on the industry, but they generally include:</li>
</ol>
<p>a list of tasks and descriptions.
a list of skills needed to complete these tasks.
tools overview and step-by-step instructions for use.
the project outline or strategy.
the format of each deliverable.
expectations in terms of performance, evaluation, and KPIs.
explanation of processes, tips, and past approaches.
possible problems or pitfalls.
senior roles the new employee will be accountable to.
other essential information for the tasks’ completion.
Shortly put, the new employee needs to take over the role as smoothly as possible, and that’s possible only if they receive clear, concise, and well-structured information.</p>
<ol start=\"2\">
<li>A progress report of ongoing or incomplete tasks
Taking over an ongoing task that hasn’t been completed by the previous “project owner” is one of the most challenging aspects of change management and handover documentation.</li>
</ol>
<p>The best solution is to provide your successor with a status update and a progress report on all open tasks that they’re about to take over.</p>
<p>Some key areas you need to include here are:</p>
<p>a list of all open tasks.
a progress report and status of each open task (milestones completed, milestones to go, or similar).
past learnings, research, and results for each task.
activities necessary to complete each task.
key stakeholders or team members involved in each task.
possible issues or pitfalls.
3. Project timelines, milestones, and deadlines
The new team or employee taking over needs to know all the upcoming project deadlines. Therefore, your handover documentation must contain a clear timeline of the milestones, as well as the start and finish dates of all upcoming projects and deliverables.</p>
<p>Often, different teams will work on the same project throughout different stages of that project. In such cases, it often helps to use visual helpers like flow charts or other color-coded ways of data visualization to gain perspective of the bigger picture.</p>
<p>Depending on the nature of the job role, it might be helpful to share the entire company calendar with the new employee. This will help them see any company events, important meetings, or task deadlines in advance.</p>
<ol start=\"4\">
<li>Workflows, processes, and operations guides
Our next essential elements of efficient handover documentation are how-to guides, training materials, standard operating procedures (SOPs), video tutorials, and similar resources. This is the instructional part of your handover documentation that will show the new employee not just “what you do” but “how you do it”.</li>
</ol>
<p>Luckily, today, a simple screen recording tool can help you capture your step-by-step workflow and processes in the form of a video. The new employee can then follow these steps and learn to do the tasks independently. For more in-depth processes, there are a number of process documentation tools to choose from.</p>
<p>While we’re on this point, it’s important to also consider handing over any operating procedures, safety policies, maintenance records, and similar documentation.</p>
<p>For larger organizations, investing in a digital adoption platform like Whatfix is an effective way to create contextual, in-app how-to guides and self-help support. With Whatfix, teams can create in-app guidance like tooltips, interactive walkthroughs, product tours, field validation, self-help wikis, and more – all these help provide contextual support to end-users, ensure process compliance, and reduce time-to-proficiency.</p>
<ol start=\"5\">
<li>The key stakeholders (handing over vs. taking over)
In every handover, there are two parties involved — the party that hands over the documentation (the departing party), and the party that takes over the documentation (the new party). These are the two main stakeholders.</li>
</ol>
<p>Every effective handover documentation should clearly outline these two parties, not just for clarity but also for accountability and tracking of responsibilities within an organization.</p>
<p>Additionally, note all other external and internal third parties that contribute or are involved in the project.</p>
<ol start=\"6\">
<li>Credentials and access
Last but not least, every handover documentation should include the necessary credentials, logins, tokens, and other account details needed for accessing software and overtaking the new role. For instance:</li>
</ol>
<p>a list of user names and passwords (social media accounts, CRM accounts, email login details).
access to codebase ownership.
CPanel/Backend login details.
access to centralized data storage clouds.
other access keys and system permissions.
Including these essential elements in your handover documentation can ensure a smooth and efficient transition and minimize disruption and errors along the way.
