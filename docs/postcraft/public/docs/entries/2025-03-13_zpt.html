    <h1>Zoom, Pan and Tilt (and Lights?)</h1>
<p>Time I got this notebook on the road before I forget everything... I have loads of notes related to #:semem scattered around, but the irony is that I need #:semem to organise them. I&#39;ll likely be repeating myself if I start writing comprehensively from scratch. But I know I have progress some ideas, so maybe a bit of braindumping - at minimum it might provide me with reminders.</p>
<p>I think it will be useful to use borrow some terms from cinematography in knowledge management. (I think I did a little braindump to this to danbri - Signal or Twitter DM?)</p>
<p>abstraction, scope, aspect</p>
<p>The knowledge base is the #:Universe, as used in logic. Mine, for current purposes with include  everything from local personal notes through project notes to the Web (especially semweb).</p>
<p>RDF graph, vector storage</p>

<ul>
<li>#:Zoom for the level of detail/abstraction</li>
<li>#:Pan for scope, domain</li>
<li>#:Tilt for the mix of layers (<em>a more literal analogy would be optical filters, but tilt lives with the two other terms which I&#39;m redefining</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>#:lingue = Lingue Franche, inter-agent messaging language</p>
<p>Zoom will take advantage of summarization in different dimensions, at multiple scales.
