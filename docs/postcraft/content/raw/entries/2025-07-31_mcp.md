# MCP Revisited

While in the process of experimenting, the MCP provision has got overcomplicated. Which is kinda funny given that I've barely played with it. I've mostly been adding a chunk of functionality, creating example code to test it in an SDK style, and then moving on to the next chunk. But each time I've tried to have corresponding MCP interfaces in place (as well as straight HTTP APIs).
This has led to *so much cruft...*

To simplify, the plan is to focus on 5 verbs and state.
The state will correspond to the current knowledgebase context in terms of zoom, pan, and tilt, as in the [ZPT Ontology](https://github.com/danja/zpt).

The verbs will allow a caller to :

* tell - add resources to the system with minimal subsequent processing
* ask - query the system
* augment - run operations such as concept extraction to parts of the knowledgebase that are relevant to the current context
* zoom - provide the level of abstraction at which to work
* pan - the subject domain of interest
* tilt - the filter through which to view the knowledgebase

The implementations in a first pass will be wrappers around existing code. Claude Code is now having a crack - it did reckon it was done, until (naturally) it tried running the tests.

> I see the issue! The server.tool() method doesn't exist.
