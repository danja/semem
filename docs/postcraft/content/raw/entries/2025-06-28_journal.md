## Semem Auth

I finally got around to moving SPARQL server credentials to `.env`. That's picked up by `src/Config.js` along with `config/config.json` andso it begins...

Auth wasn't something I was going to bother with at this stage, but while working on the HTTP API at some point Claude slipped in the use of an API key, which I've shifted into `.env`. The implementation looked ok so I went with it. Forgetting that if the API needs auth, the existing clients won't work.

The HTTP API bits were really sketchy anyway, not remotely consistent. So I went back over them and they should now be ok, with `examples/http-api` in sync.

Which means it's now time to revisit -

## Semem UI

It has loads of tabs which currently either don't do *anything*, or are not quite right yet. And now they all need adjusting to take into account the auth. But I've now got all the CLI examples as reference, so it shouldn't be too difficult to get things working in the GUI.

In the same way **CLI examples can act as integration tests**, so **GUI can act as tutorial**.

Which is what I need desperately myself, to figure out how to wire all this stuff up. After the initial conceptual designs I left an awful lot to Claude and I'm very uncertain about a lot that's happening under the hood. It does seem to be as I wanted architecturally, but I haven't much clue about the detail.
