# Devlog 2025-08-20

We've been mostly focused on [Semem](https://github.com/danja/semem) in the past few weeks. The good news is that it now has a new UI. Not so good is that it isn't quite working.

It calls against the MCP HTTP endpoints so, in theory at least, it should work exactly the same. But the STDIO MCP interface will be a bit out of sync now. Although that shares most of the same underlying code, the calls won't yet be properly glued together.
