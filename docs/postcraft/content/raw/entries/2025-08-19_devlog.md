# Devlog 2025-08-20

We've been mostly focused on [Semem](https://github.com/danja/semem) in the past few weeks. The good news is that it now has a new UI. Not so good is that it isn't quite working. 

It calls against the MCP http endpoints

I created the Semem repo on 2024-11-18, the Transmissions repo 2024-01-25.
