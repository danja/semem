Please create documentation for the API as described in `docs/description_latest/2025-01-13_api-req.md` and implemented in the files under `src/api`. For each of the five access modes there should be an individual artifact in markdown including at least an overview of features, a quick start with usage examples and a comprehensive list of features, with code examples as appropriate. A further artifact, an index page should give a short description of the five access modes.
