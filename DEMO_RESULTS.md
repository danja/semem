   - Links environmental stressors to cognitive load and decision-making
   - Synthesizes knowledge from climate science and neuroscience

3. **"How do feedback loops work in both climate systems and memory formation?"**
   - Identifies common patterns in complex systems across domains
   - Demonstrates system's ability to find conceptual parallels

4. **"What role does plasticity play in both urban development and brain function?"**
   - Connects neuroplasticity concepts with urban adaptability
   - Shows cross-domain concept mapping capabilities

5. **"How do ocean circulation patterns compare to information flow in neural networks?"**
   - Reveals analogical reasoning between physical and biological systems
   - Demonstrates sophisticated semantic understanding

6. **"What sustainability principles apply to both cities and ecosystems?"**
   - Synthesizes knowledge from urban planning and climate science
   - Shows capability for abstract principle extraction
