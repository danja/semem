There have been changes to the code meaning that the tests may now be out of sync. I will run the tests and give the results below. Please review the test source and the corresponding code and fix any issues. First assume the code is correct, analyse what it is meant to do and check the test to see if it is testing the correct thing. Only once you have ruled out issues with the test should you consider that the code may be incorrect.
Please give corrected code as complete individual artifact containing full source code.
