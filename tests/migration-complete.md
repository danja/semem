# Migration Complete: Jasmine to Vitest

The migration from Jasmine to Vitest has been successfully completed. All previously Jasmine-based tests have been converted to Vitest format and are now passing.

## Migrated Files

1. Core unit tests:
   - Config.vitest.js
   - ContextWindowManager.vitest.js
   - MemoryManager.vitest.js

2. API tests:
   - APILogger.vitest.js
   - BaseAPI.vitest.js
   - CLIHandler.vitest.js
   - REPLHandler.vitest.js

3. HTTP and networking:
   - message-queue.vitest.js
   - WebSocketServer.vitest.js

4. SPARQL integration:
   - SPARQLEndpoint.vitest.js

## Running the Tests

To run the Vitest tests, use the following commands:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- tests/unit/Config.vitest.js

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## Cleanup

To remove the old Jasmine files, run the cleanup script:

```bash
./cleanup-jasmine.sh
```

Then remove the Jasmine dependencies:

```bash
npm uninstall jasmine jasmine-spec-reporter --save-dev
```

## Documentation

For more information about the migration process and patterns used, see:

- [Migration Guide](tests/jasmine-to-vitest-migration.md)
- [Files to Remove](jasmine_files_to_remove.txt)
- [Migration Summary](tests/migration-summary.md)

## Next Steps

1. Consider standardizing test file extensions to `.test.js` instead of `.vitest.js`
2. Revisit skipped tests and implement proper Vitest versions
3. Update documentation to refer to Vitest instead of Jasmine
4. Expand test coverage for error cases

**Note**: Some pre-existing tests in the codebase may still show errors that are unrelated to our Jasmine-to-Vitest migration. Those issues should be addressed separately.
