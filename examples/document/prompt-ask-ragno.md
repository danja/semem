Create `examples/document/AskRagno.md` that will allow the user to enter a question and get the answer. Processing of the question should begin with calls following the patterns of those in `examples/document/ConsumeQuestion.js` to place the question in the store. The URI of the question corpuscle should then be sent through code following the pattern of `examples/document/Search.js` to find relevant information. The retrieved text should then be formulated into a chat completion prompt, sent through the configured llm and the response retruned to the user. Check `docs/manual/infrastructure.md` for details of system config. Corresponding vitest unit and integrations tests should be created, using the config as defined by the system in use.
