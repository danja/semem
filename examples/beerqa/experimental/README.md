# BeerQA Experimental Tools

This directory contains experimental and research tools that are not part of the core enhanced workflow but may have future value.

## Contents

### Workflows Directory
- `EnhancedWorkflow.js` - Experimental enhanced workflow implementation
- `GraphPreprocessor.js` - Graph preprocessing utilities 
- `WorkflowComparison.js` - Workflow comparison and benchmarking tools

## Usage

These tools are experimental and may:
- Use outdated configuration patterns
- Have dependencies that are not maintained
- Require manual setup or parameter adjustment
- Not follow the Config.js patterns used in the core workflow

## Integration

If you want to use these tools with the enhanced v2 workflow:
1. Update them to use Config.js initialization patterns
2. Align graph URIs with config-extras.json
3. Test thoroughly with current infrastructure

## Historical Context

These files were moved during the v2 workflow cleanup on 2025-06-30 to reduce complexity while preserving potentially useful research implementations.
