    Generate a conversational response using the configured language model with 
    optional semantic memory integration.
    
    When `useMemory` is enabled, the system:
    1. Searches semantic memory for relevant past interactions
    2. Includes relevant context in the prompt
    3. Generates a response informed by historical knowledge
    4. Optionally stores the new interaction in memory
    
    This enables AI agents to maintain context and continuity across conversations.
