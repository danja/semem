    This endpoint allows you to add documents, web pages, or other textual
    content to the search index. The content will be processed for:
    - Vector embedding generation
    - Keyword extraction and indexing
    - Metadata extraction and storage
    - Content type classification
    
    Indexed content becomes immediately searchable via the search endpoint.
