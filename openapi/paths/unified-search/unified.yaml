  summary: Unified Cross-Service Search
  description: |
    Perform intelligent search across all available Semem services with automatic
    query analysis, service routing, and result aggregation.
    
    The unified search system:
    1. Analyzes the query to understand intent and optimal search strategy
    2. Routes the query to relevant services (Memory, Ragno, Search, ZPT)
    3. Executes parallel searches across selected services
    4. Aggregates and ranks results using configurable weights
    5. Returns unified results with source attribution
    
    **Search Strategies**:
    - `auto`: Automatic strategy selection based on query analysis
    - `entity-focused`: Prioritizes entity-based searches (Ragno)
    - `concept-focused`: Emphasizes semantic concept matching
    - `graph-focused`: Focuses on knowledge graph relationships
    - `navigation-focused`: Uses ZPT for corpus exploration
    - `knowledge-focused`: Comprehensive knowledge retrieval
    - `balanced`: Equal weighting across all services
