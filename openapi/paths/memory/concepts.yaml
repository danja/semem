  description: |
    Extract semantic concepts from text using LLM-based analysis.
    
    This endpoint uses the configured language model to analyze text and 
    identify key semantic concepts, topics, and themes. The extracted concepts
    are used by the memory system for improved search and retrieval.
    
    Concept extraction helps with:
    - Semantic indexing and search
    - Topic modeling and categorization
    - Content analysis and understanding
    - Memory organization and clustering
