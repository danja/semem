  summary: Generate Text Embedding
  description: |
    Generate vector embeddings for arbitrary text using the configured embedding model.
    
    This endpoint provides direct access to the embedding generation capability
    used internally by the memory system. Useful for:
    - Custom similarity calculations
    - Text preprocessing workflows
    - External vector database integrations
    - Research and development purposes
    
    Returns a high-dimensional vector representation of the input text.
