  summary: Store Memory Interaction
  description: |
    Store a new interaction (prompt-response pair) in semantic memory.
    
    The system will automatically:
    - Generate vector embeddings for the combined text
    - Extract semantic concepts using LLM analysis
    - Store the interaction with metadata for future retrieval
    
    This is the primary way to build up the AI agent's memory over time.
