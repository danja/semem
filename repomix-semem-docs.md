File Summary
================================================================

Purpose:
--------
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

File Format:
------------
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A separator line (================)
  b. The file path (File: path/to/file)
  c. Another separator line
  d. The full contents of the file
  e. A blank line

Usage Guidelines:
-----------------
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.
- Pay special attention to the Repository Description. These contain important context and guidelines specific to this project.

Notes:
------
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's
  configuration.
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to
  the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including
  binary files.

Needs a SPARQL endpoint - like #:tbox

```sh
cd ~/github-danny/hyperdata/packages/tbox/

 docker-compose up -d
```

```sh
cd ~/github-danny/hyperdata/packages/semem

node src/OllamaExample.js

```

Needs SPARQL store, endpoint 127.0.0.1:4030

```sh
cd ~/github-danny/hyperdata/packages/tbox
docker-compose up -d

 node src/SPARQLExample.js

```

```sh
cd ~/github-danny/hyperdata/packages/tbox
docker-compose up -d
cd ~/github-danny/hyperdata/packages/semem
node src/OllamaClaudeExample.js

```sh
# ollama pull nomic-embed-text

curl http://localhost:11434/api/embeddings -d '{
  "model": "nomic-embed-text",
  "prompt": "The sky is blue because of Rayleigh scattering"
}'
```

```sh
npm test -- --filter="SPARQL Endpoint Integration"
```
