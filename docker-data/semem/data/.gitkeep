# Docker volume mount point for Semem application data
# This directory will contain:
# - Memory files
# - Embeddings cache
# - Application state
# - Runtime data files
#
# The actual data files are ignored by git but this placeholder
# ensures the directory structure exists for Docker volume mounts.
