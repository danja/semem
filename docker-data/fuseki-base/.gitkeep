# Docker volume mount point for Fuseki base directory
# This directory will contain:
# - Fuseki templates directory
# - Configuration files
# - Runtime files needed by the Fuseki container
# 
# The actual files are ignored by git but this placeholder
# ensures the directory structure exists for Docker volume mounts.
